    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A true French omelette is just eggs and butter, no filling. <br>
        The egg is folded for a soft, tender texture. <br>
        The technique does take a bit of practice to perfect but <br>
        you'll be amazed at just how delicious these few ingredients <br>
         can be when elevated using this method.</p> <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large fresh eggs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cold water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne or white pepper to taste</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, water, and salt together in a mixing bowl. <br>
            Whisk until mixture is very liquid and whites are <br>
             completely blended in, 1 or 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 ½ tablespoons butter in a 9- or 10-inch nonstick <br>
            skillet over medium-high heat. As soon as butter melts <br>
             and before it starts to sizzle, pour in whisked eggs. <br>
              Stir in a circular pattern with a heat-proof spatula, <br>
              lifting and scrambling eggs, shaking the pan to keep <br>
              leveling out the mixture, and scraping down the sides. <br>
             Continue stirring until shaking the pan no longer levels <br>
              the eggs.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low. Using the spatula, smooth the surface to <br>
             move runny eggs to less runny spots, working toward <br>
              an even thickness. As soon as the surface is wet but not <br>
               runny, remove from heat.</li>
        <li>
            Starting at the handle side of the pan, use the spatula <br>
            to begin rolling omelette into a cylinder shape, about 3 <br>
            rolls until omelette is about 2 inches from opposite side <br>
            of the pan. Use the spatula to fold the last flap of egg <br>
            over the top of the cylinder leaving the seam-side up. Add <br>
             remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter to the pan. Gently push <br>
             the butter as it melts under the omelette.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slide omelette to edge of the pan. Flip onto a plate with <br>
            the seam-side down. Even out the shape, if necessary. You <br>
             can tuck in the ends, if you like. Brush surface with a bit <br>
              more butter. Dust with cayenne pepper.
        </li>
    </ol>
