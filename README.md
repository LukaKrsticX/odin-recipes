# Odin Recipes

A simple recipe website built with pure HTML, completed as the first project in The Odin Project curriculum.

## 📖 Overview

This project is a foundational exercise in HTML. It demonstrates the use of core HTML elements to structure a multi page website, including links, images, lists, and semantic tags. The goal was to create a functional, interlinked site using only HTML, without any CSS for styling.

## 🚀 Live Preview

## 🛠️ Built With

*   **HTML5** - The sole technology used for structure and content.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
odin-recipes/
│
├── index.html          # The homepage with a list of recipes
├── recipes/
│   ├── lasagna.html       # Recipe page for Lasagna
│   ├── pancakes.html      # Recipe page for Pancakes
│   └── guacamole.html     # Recipe page for Guacamole
└── README.md           # Project documentation (this file)
```

## ✨ Features

*   **Clean Navigation:** Easy-to-use links to navigate between the homepage and individual recipe pages.
*   **Structured Content:** Each recipe page is organized with ingredients (unordered list) and step-by-step instructions (ordered list).
*   **Semantic HTML:** Uses appropriate tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, and `<ol>` for better accessibility and structure.

## 🎯 What I Learned

This project was a great back-to-basics experience. Focusing purely on HTML helped solidify my understanding of:

*   Creating a multi page website structure.
*   Using absolute and relative paths for links and images.
*   Properly nesting HTML elements.
*   Writing semantic HTML to create a meaningful document outline.

As I noted in my inspiration, *"It was fun doing something with only HTML, it was a while since I was limited to only HTML."* This constraint was a valuable reminder of HTML's core role as the skeleton of the web.
